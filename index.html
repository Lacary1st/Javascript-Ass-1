       document.getElementById('experience').innerHTML="I hope this Javascript class will change my mentality about Javascript entirely. I have been made to understand that Javascript is hard and only for the highly intellectual, but being an average student, I look forward to what Javascript will make out of me LOL. To begin with, I want to appreciate the simplicity of the lecturer, in respect of  Mr Omolewu Sunday, who made my first class a simple and stress-free class, with this, I will be looking forward to more of the classes. The class started when my lecturer introduced Javascript with the definition that its a programming language used in making HTML  dynamnic and to also manipulate HTML contents. He further explained what Computer Programming is, by saying its the set of instructions or commands given to computer to perform certain task. He further introduced SYNTAX, which he said are rules followed when writing Javascript. He mentioned STRING, which he explained as combinations of Alphabets, Numbers, Symbols or collection of Characters. String MUST be in quotes,either doubled or single. Furthermore, he explained the 3 types of writing Javascript,which are, Inline,Internal and External. He talked about ways to output Javascript,such as , alert(), document.write(), to mention few. To end the class, he laid emphasis on a command document.getElementById().innerHTML which he said is the command we will be using till he introduces another command.He gave me an assignment which is why I am writing this.Hmm! I hope all Javascript classes can start and end in this manner, simple, interesting and not bulky. This is how MY FIRST JAVASCRIPT CLASS went. ";
